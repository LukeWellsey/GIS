# Overview

My goal for this project is to map out areas around Eastern Idaho that I enjoy exploring. I hope to be able to gain more exposure to GIS Mapping solutions.

# Development Environment

I designed this to be accessible from the web, so the map is embedded in an HTML page. I've customized the HTML with some CSS to provide a cleaner looking experience.

Javascript provides the main control and customization for the basemap and other attributes listed in the documentation.

# Future Work

* I'd love to add a search box that will allow users to enter a location and pull it up
* Providing the ability to save or bookmark locations and hide/show them on the map, maybe even with different color customization would be handy
* Calculating travel time from one point to another would be a fun challenge
* Animating movements from one location to another using goTo would be interesting to look into, similar to how Google Earth starts by flying into your location
