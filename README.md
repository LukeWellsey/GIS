# Overview

My goal for this project is to map out areas around Eastern Idaho that I enjoy exploring. I hope to be able to gain more exposure to GIS Mapping solutions.

{Provide a description the map software that you wrote. Describe how to use your software.  Describe the source of the data that you used.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I designed this to be accessible from the web, so the map is embedded in an HTML page. I've customized the HTML with some CSS to provide a cleaner looking experience.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}

# Future Work

* I'd love to add a search box that will allow users to enter a location and pull it up
* Providing the ability to save or bookmark locations and hide/show them on the map, maybe even with different color customization would be handy
* Calculating travel time from one point to another would be a fun challenge
